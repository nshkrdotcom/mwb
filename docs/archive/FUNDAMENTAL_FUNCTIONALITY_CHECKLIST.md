# Fundamental Functionality Checklist

This checklist is derived from the canonical 20260625 archive:

- `0001.md` archive charter and decisions
- `0002.md` product PRD and Phase 0 dogfood spec
- `0003.md` system architecture and domain model
- `0004.md` IPython session capture spec
- `0005.md` scientific workflow, verification, next-probe, and claim grammar
- `0006.md` adapter strategy, provenance archive, and Phase 2 boundary

It intentionally excludes P1/P2 integrations and platform work that the archive says should wait until the local Phase 0 loop proves value.

## Definition Of Fundamental

A feature is fundamental only if it is necessary for the local-first IPython research loop to preserve provenance, prevent evidence confusion, or bound claims against real dogfood artifacts.

Fundamental items must be:

- covered by tests or real command transcripts,
- documented in the repo,
- QC-green before commit,
- committed and pushed manually,
- non-claim-bearing unless the evidence gate requirements are met.

## Fundamental Non-Goals

These are intentionally deferred because the canonical archive excludes them from Phase 0:

- [ ] Dashboard-first UI.
- [ ] Cloud sync or multi-user collaboration.
- [ ] Distributed workers or NSHKR service split.
- [ ] nnsight/nnterp claim-bearing parity.
- [ ] pyvene hard dependency or claim-bearing execution path.
- [ ] Neuronpedia write integration.
- [ ] OpenInterpretability, circuit-tracer, CLT-Forge, SAEBench, RAVEL, Tracr, Inspect, or lm-eval interop.
- [ ] Filesystem watching for arbitrary artifacts.
- [ ] Raw tensor/model-weight capture by default.

## Fundamental QC Gate

Run this gate before any commit that changes fundamental behavior:

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
MWB_RUN_REAL_ADAPTER_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/test_phase4_context.py -m integration
uv run mwb adapter conformance transformer-lens --model EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped --device cpu
uv run mwb adapter conformance saelens --model EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped --hook blocks.2.hook_resid_post --device cpu
uv run mwb doctor
uv run mwb repair-index --output .mechanism/workbench.repaired.sqlite
```

Every gate failure is either fixed with RGR or recorded as explicit non-fundamental debt before commit.
